# BOLT
‚ö°Ô∏è Bolt ‚Äî The Electricity-Generating Smart Ball
Bolt is an innovative ball designed to generate electricity through its rotational movement. Originally inspired by a standard football, Bolt has evolved into a smart energy-harvesting device made with durable, flexible TPU material via 3D printing. This project combines mechanics, materials science, and energy harvesting to transform everyday motion into usable power.

üåü Project Overview
Bolt harnesses the kinetic energy generated when the ball spins or rolls and converts it into electrical energy. This energy can be used to power small devices or stored for later use, making Bolt a unique blend of sports, sustainability, and technology.

üîß Key Features
Energy Generation: Converts rotational kinetic energy into electricity

Durable TPU Construction: 3D-printed using thermoplastic polyurethane for flexibility and resilience

Optimized Design: Improved internal mechanisms for efficient power generation

Sustainable & Portable: Encourages green energy harvesting through play

Modular Design: Allows easy upgrades and customization

üß∞ Components & Materials
